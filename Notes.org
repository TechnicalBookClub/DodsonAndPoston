      We want to justify the relationship
      $\phi^i_t(x^1, \ldots, x^n) = (x^1, \ldots, x^i+t, \ldots, x^n)$.

      Note that $M \ni \vec{x} = (x^1, \ldots, x^n) = \theta(0, \ldots, 0)$, so the LHS can be rewritten
      $\phi^i_t(\theta(0, \ldots, 0)) = \phi^i_t \circ \theta(0, \ldots, 0)$

      Using [[id:20230725T181337.092381][6.05]] (and going through the proof backwards), this becomes
      $\theta(0,\ldots,t,\ldots,0)$ with the $t$ in the $i$ slot, which is the same
      as $\vec{x} + t\vec{e}_i = (x^1, \ldots, x^i+t, \ldots, x^n)$

      composition of all these \phi's is a point in M.  The fact that \phi^1 is smooth

 D_{p}w   : TM    \rightarrow  T(TM)

 - t is the velocity on M (t \in T_{p}M) (so in TM it is "vertical", but in M it
   points to the right.)
 - D_{p}w(t) describes the change of w(p) at velocity t.  In TM, the horizontal
 component of this vector is |t| and its tail is at w(p).
 - \Pi is a projection that takes points in TM and maps them to M. All points in
   T_{p}M map to p, and likewise for other fibers in TM.
 - D_{w(p)}\Pi maps vectors in T(TM) into vectors in TM. A vector between points w(p)
   and q in TM is in the tangent space T_{w(p)}(TM) and maps to a vector in M from p
   to \Pi(q).

   The difficulty for me here is that there are two "represenatations" of T_{p}M in
   Figure 3.1 - the horizontal one at the bottom of the figure, and the fiber in
   TM. \Pi projects points down into M, and D_{x}\Pi projects vectors down into the
   "horizontal representation" of T_{x}M, not the "vertical representation."

In the [third] section we introduce the Lie bracket operation, which is a way of
combining two smooth vector fields to obtain another. Then we describe the most
important application of Lie brackets: the set of all smooth vector fields on a Lie
group that are invariant under left multiplication is closed under Lie brackets, and
thus forms an algebraic object naturally associated with the group, called the Lie
algebra of the Lie group.

Thus it became customary to call tangent covectors *covariant vectors* because
their components transform in the same way as (“vary with”) the coordinate
partial derivatives, the Jacobian matrix multiplying the objects associated with
the “new” coordinates to obtain those associated with the “old” coordinates.
Analogously, tangent vectors were called *contravariant vectors*, because their
components transform in the opposite way.

**** I.5.2 Def: the differential $df$ is a 1-form (p 23)
     If $f$ is a differentiable real-valued function on $\mathbb{E}^3$, $df(\vec{v}_p) = \vec{v}_p[f]$
     examples:
     - $dx_i[\vec{v}_p] = v_i$
     - in $\mathbb{E}^3$, any 1-form has the form $f dx + g dy + h dz$, where f,g,
       and h are differentiable real valued functions


     interpretation:
     - on the RHS, the vector acting on a function is the directional derivative
       in the vector direction.
     - on the LHS, $df = f_x dx + f_y dy + f_z dz$.
     - in components, the expression above is $v_x \partial_x f + v_y \partial_y f + v_z \partial_z f$

     :PROPERTIES:

     :END:
     Let $F \colon \mathbb{E}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^m$ be a mapping.  If $\vec{v} \in
     T_{\mathbf{p}} \mathbb{E}^n$, then let $F_*(\vec{v}) \in T_{F(\mathbf{p})} \mathbb{E}^m$ be the initial velocity of the curve
     $t \rightarrow F(\mathbf{p} + t\vec{v})$.  $F_*$ is the /derivative map/ of $F$.

     This is the equivalent of $D_x f$ in D&P.

**** I.7.8 Thm: F_* preserves the velocity of curves (p 38)
     Given curve $\alpha$ and mapping $F$, if curve $\beta = F(\alpha)$, then $\beta' = F_*(\alpha')$

**** I.7.9 Thm: Inverse function theorem (p 39)

     $\mathbf{p}$, $F(\mathbf{p + \Delta p}) \approx F(\mathbf{p}) + F_*(\mathbf{\Delta p})$''

*** I.8 Summary (p 41)
    Oneill gives a differentiation operation for each object introduced:

    | object        | diff op                |
    |---------------+------------------------|
    | function in R | directional derivative |
    | form          | exterior derivative    |
    | curve         | velocity               |
    | mapping       | derivative map         |
    | ...           |                        |
    | vector field  | connection (??)        |

    All of the differentiation operations here (first 4) reduce to ordinary or
    partial derivatives of real-valued coordinate functions, but the
    /definitions/ do not involve coordinates.

** II Frame Fields

*** II.1.4 Def: /frame/ (p 44)
    A frame at point p is a set {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n} mutually orthogonal unit
    vectors in $\mathbb{E}^n$

*** II.2.2 Def: /vector field *on* a curve/ (p 52)
    This is NOT the same definition used in Tu or D&P -- *on* here does not
    require that the vectors be tangent to the curve itself.  In Tu and D&P,
    this would be *along* a curve.  Oneill does not seem to use any terminology
    to describe the set of vectors tangent to the curve aside from calling it
    a parameterization of the velocity of the curve.

*** II.5 Covariant derivatives (p 77)
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       20230805T082310.839163
    :END:
    Covariant derivatives apply to vector fields, but the notion "belongs
    properly to the /geometry/ of Euclidean space."

    Here, again, the O'neill uses "vector field *on* the curve" as a field that
    is not necessarily tangent to the curve, which is *along* in other texts.
**** Ex II.5.7 Lie bracket
     The Lie bracket is introduced in this exercise simply as the /bracket/.
     No mention of the torsion tensor.
*** II.6 Frame fields (p 81)
    Frenet (1847) equations covered here and in Needham apply to curves.  They
    generalize /frame fields/ of surfaces (Darboux ~1880) and manifolds (Cartan
    ~1900).

    Frenet equations involve T,N,B,\kappa,\tau and are shown to be embedded in the frame
    field equations.
**** II.6.1 Def: /frame field/
     A frame field is an orthonormal set of vector fields on a manifold.
**** II.6.3 Examples: cylindrical, spherical
     toroidal frame field is Ex II.6.4
*** II.7 Connection forms (p 85)
    $\omega_{ij}(\vec{v}) = \nabla_{\vec{v}} E_i \cdot E_j(\vec{p})$ where the E_i's are a frame
    field on $\mathbb{E}^n$ and $\vec{v}$ is a tangent vector at point $\vec{p}$.

    *Each* \omega_{ij} is a connection 1-form representing the initial rate of rotation
    as E_i rotates toward E_j as p moves in the v direction.

**** II.7.2 Thm: /connection equations/ of the frame field
     Let E_1, E_2, E_3 be a frame field in $\mathbb{E}^3$, then the /connection
     equations/ of the frame field for any vector field V are
     $\nabla_V E_i = \sum_j \omega_{ij}(V) \cdot E_j$ due to the orthonormality of the frame.

     Evidently, [\omega_{ij}] is a 3x3 antisymmetric matrix.  Note that the diagonal
     elements are all zero (due to asymmetry) and the (1,3) and (3,1) are the
     part of the connection equations (for surfaces) that do NOT appear in the
     Frenet equations for curves.

**** II.7.3 Thm: attitude matrix A = (a_{ij}) and the matrix of connection forms.
     The attitude matrix relates the standard basis (U_j) unit vectors to an
     arbitrary frame field (E_i) by
     $E_i = a_{ij} U_j$

     the matrix of connection forms is then the matrix product
     $\omega  = dA\ A^T$ (see proof)

     rate of change."
* Torsion
https://jollywatt.github.io/simple-torsion-example - example of a connection
with non-zero torsion.

There is a sign error in \Gamma_x (3rd equation), but it doesn't hurt (or help) the
exposition.  From the 3rd eqn on, replace k with -k.

The vector field u(x,y) in this example defines a set of geodesics on the plane.
I believe these are U-shaped curves over the intervals x \in (-\pi/2 + n\pi, pi/2 +
n\pi) with right-ward flow for even n and left-ward flow for odd n.

From the requirement that \nabla_{\mu}u = 0 (rather than direct calculation), the nonzero
Chrisoffel symbols are
\Gamma^x_{x,y} = k
\Gamma^y_{x,x} = -k

Right now [2023-09-17 Sun 22:12], I don't understand the geometric
interpretation of these Chrisoffel symbols.

** D&P VIII.6?
   [[id:20230728T180154.910466][5.01: T=0 ==> \nabla is symmetric]] according to Tu, this is an iff situation.
** Tu (DG)
   [[id:20230728T222528.412533][Torsion of the directional derivative D]]
   (A.2) Lie bracket: $[X,Y]_p f = X_p(Yf) - Y_p(Xf)$ for $p \in M, f \in C^\infty_p(M)$
    $T(X,Y) = D_X Y - D_Y X - [X,Y]$
    from [[id:20230728T223937.753217][p 25]], the first two terms above are the Lie bracket, so T(X,Y) = 0
    always (for Euclidean space?)

   For a [[id:20230728T224820.672509][Submanifold of R^n]], the torsion "no longer makes sense."  Why? because
   X is on M and Y is along M?

   Appears again in the context of manifolds in [[id:20230728T230735.534842][6.2 Torsion and Curvature]].
** Needham
   Needham's [[id:20230730T180941.170844][definition: Torsion]] is a property of a curve in 3-space, so it
   appears to be fundamentally different from the concept of torsion in D&P and Tu.
** Frenkel
   maybe connects the different concepts
   - Torsion :: of a curve
   - Torsion form :: 2-form (p 245, same as [[id:20230728T180154.910466][D&P 229]])

   - \Gamma_{\theta,\theta} = 0 :: becaue we are  always on a GC.
   - \Gamma_{\theta,\varphi} = cot\theta (\varphi) ::
     The cos factor comes from the the projection of the unit e_\theta vector into
     the "horizontal" plane.
     The 1/sin factor must be attributed to the non-unit-vectorness of e_\varphi.
     Since we are talking about a vector component in that direction, we need to
     normalize against the magnitude of that vector.
   - \Gamma_{\varphi,\theta} = cot\theta e_\varphi ::
     The e_\varphi basis vector has magnitude sin\theta, which changes in magnitude as cos\theta
     in the e_\theta direction.  As in the prior case, the change is entirely in the
     e_\varphi basis direction, which is not a unit vector, so we need to normalize
     against its magnitude, bringing in the 1/sin\theta factor.
   - \Gamma_{\varphi,\varphi} = -sin\theta cos\theta e_\theta ::
     On the equator (\theta = \pi/2), this is obviously zero because we are travelling on a
     geodesic.

     At \theta = \pi/4, the change in e_\varphi wrt \varphi is maximal.  The geodesic dips towards
     the equator as one travels in the \varphi direction, bringing in the \theta component.

     As we approach the poles, the geodesics cross the equator at more
     perpendicular angle, becoming lines of longitude in the limit \theta \rightarrow 0 and \theta \rightarrow
     \pi.  In the cylidrical projection of the sphere, the geodesics plateau near
     the poles.  In this projection, the length of e_\varphi does *NOT* vary with \theta,
     which is consistent with this Christoffel symbol going to zero at the
     poles.

     Sticking strictly with the spherical view, the sin\theta factor comes from the
     magnitude of e_\varphi, while the cos\theta factor is the tilt of the geodesic wrt the
     polar axis.  The tilt of the geodesic suppresses this Christoffel symbol
     near the equator and intoduces the asymmetry about the equator.

     Since e_\theta is a unit vector, there is nothing interesing in the denominator.

   Indeed, this is zero at the equator (\pi/2), but why is the total derivative
   maximal at \pm\pi/4?  shouldn't it be monotonically increasing in magnitude
   toward the poles?

   My guess is that this should look more like -cot(2\theta_0) -- asymmetric about the
   equator, with zero derivative wrt \theta_0, and heading to \pm\infty at the poles.  Did a
   1/\cos(2\theta_0) get dropped somewhere?
