    If we have a linearly independent and commuting set of vector functions that
    span a manifold, then they can be "realized" as the basis vectors (\partial_i's) of
    some chart.

    These flows have constant velocity in the neighborhood of x. (see example in
    preface to this section.)

     We want to justify the relationship
     $\phi^i_t(x^1, \ldots, x^n) = (x^1, \ldots, x^i+t, \ldots, x^n)$.

     Note that $M \ni \vec{x} = (x^1, \ldots, x^n) = \theta(0, \ldots, 0)$, so the LHS can be rewritten
     $\phi^i_t(\theta(0, \ldots, 0)) = \phi^i_t \circ \theta(0, \ldots, 0)$

     Using [[6.05]] (and going through the proof backwards), this becomes
     $\theta(0,\ldots,t,\ldots,0)$ with the $t$ in the $i$ slot, which is the same
     as $\vec{x} + t\vec{e}_i = (x^1, \ldots, x^i+t, \ldots, x^n)$

     In the proof, this appears with parameter $s$ instead of $t$.

     \theta(t^{1}...t^n) is a point in M.  By varying one of the t's, it describes a curve
     on M.
     \theta(0,0,0....0) = x \in M.
     As a map, \theta: R^n \rightarrow M, so it *might* be the inverse of a chart function.

     why only \phi^1?  Each \phi^i_t(x) moves the point along its flow line, so the
     composition of all these \phi's is a point in M.  The fact that \phi^1 is smooth
     means that through arbitrary points in M, \phi^1 defines a smooth flow, so \theta is
     also smooth through arbitrary points in M.

    The vertical part of a vector $\vec{v}$ in the space of derivatives of
    tangent vectors is the part normal to the tangent space, while the
    horizontal part of the vector is the part in the tangent space.

    The projection $P_w$ defined in this section is the projection to the
    "vertical." It corresponds to $\langle\vec{v}, \hat{n}\rangle\hat{n}$ in Tu Sec 6.4,

    A vector field v along c \in M is /parallel/ if the horizontal component of
    its derivative along c^* is zero.  In other words, at each point along the
    curve, the corresponding vector from the field must maintain the same angle
    with respect to the tangent to the curve.

    ``v, considered as a curve in TM, has c*(t) horizontal for all t''

    Just like the "rolling" business in this book, I'm not sure the
    "vertical"/"horizontal" distinction is pedegogically useful.  In order to
    picture nontrivial parallel transport, we need at minimum, a 2D surface
    embedded in 3D.  M is 2D, so v \in TM is also 2D, but c*(t) \in T(TM) is 4D --
    hard to picture.  Are there 2 horizontal dimensions and 2 vertical
    dimensions?  This is *much* easier to follow in Needham.

In the [third] section we introduce the Lie bracket operation, which is a way of
combining two smooth vector fields to obtain another. Then we describe the most
important application of Lie brackets: the set of all smooth vector fields on a Lie
group that are invariant under left multiplication is closed under Lie brackets, and
thus forms an algebraic object naturally associated with the group, called the Lie
algebra of the Lie group.

For smooth vector fields V and W on a smooth manifold M; the
following are equivalent:
(a) V and W commute.
(b) W is invariant under the flow of V .
(c) V is invariant under the flow of W .

Consider
\rho =  x/r i  +  y/r j  # radial vec field "E1" p179
\theta = -y/r i  +  x/r j  # unit rotation    "E2" p179
\phi =   -y i  +    x j  # disc rotation    "W" p207

[E1, E2] = -E2
[E1,  W] = 0

  1. follow E1 out in r
     for E2, the vector at positions in the flow of E1 are constant
     Q: Is E2 invariant under the flow of E1 ?? [A: no]

     for W,  the vector at positions in the flow of E1 are increasing in magnitude.
     Q: Is W invariant under the flow of E1 ?? [A: yes]

  2. follow a streamline in E2 or W
     The change in \rho is tangential to the flow.  In W, d\rho is constant, but in E2,
     d\rho is smaller at larger radial positions.

Thus it became customary to call tangent covectors *covariant vectors* because
their components transform in the same way as (“vary with”) the coordinate
partial derivatives, the Jacobian matrix multiplying the objects associated with
the “new” coordinates to obtain those associated with the “old” coordinates.
Analogously, tangent vectors were called *contravariant vectors*, because their
components transform in the opposite way.
