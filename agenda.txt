   - Randy :: Metric connections: Prop 5.5, pg 118 of Lee‚Äôs Riemannian Manifolds
     book lists equivalent conditions (a)-(g) for a connection ‚àá on a Riemannian
     manifold. While the proof of how they are derived from each other is
     straightforward enough, I‚Äôm uncertain what (b) ‚Äúg is parallel with respect
     to ‚àá; ‚àág = 0‚Äù means. The metric g_ij is defined as the inner product of the
     basis vectors e_i and e_j, i.e., g_ij = <e_i,e_j>. Since e_i and e_j change
     due to curvature for points along the manifold, as reflected in the
     Christoffel symbols, I‚Äôm not sure what ‚àág = 0 means.

   - Randy :: The Riemannian connection (aka Levi-Civita) is defined, in part,
     as having its Christoffel symbols as being symmetric; (Œì^k)_ij =
     (Œì^k)_ji. D&P show on pg. 230 that the commutivity of the partial
     derivatives in definition of (Œì^k)_ij leads to

     (Œì^k)_ij = (‚àá_‚àÇi)‚àÇj = (‚àá_‚àÇj)‚àÇi = (Œì^k)_ji

     so the (Œì^k)_ij are symmetric by definition. Why does this condition have to be imposed?

      if c(t) = (1/3)t^3
      then c'(t) = t^2

      want c'(t) = v(c) = c^{2/3} = (1/3)^{2/3}t^2 \ne c'(t)

      whereas with the correction
      c'(t) = (t/3)^2
      v(c) = c^{2/3} = (t/3)^2 = c'(t)

    - reparameterization is mentioned in VII.5.02, t \to t+m for any constant m

      so in this case, another curve that is a reparameterization of c(t) could
      be h(s) = c(t+s)

   - VII.2.7 commentary
     a. use determinants
        - Randy: On pg. 63 (Sect 6.3), Tu establishes that the coordinate (chart) functions œà and œÜ on smooth manifolds are smooth. The proof follows basically the approach described in the 1st reference, namely, that
          1) A map F between manifolds N and M, F : N ‚Üí M, is smooth if œà ùò∞ F ùò∞ œÜ^-1 is smooth and vice versa, where œà and œÜ are chart functions in M and N, respectively.
          2) Let ùüô_œÜ(U) be the identity chart function for œÜ(U) to itself, i.e.,  ùüô_œÜ(U) : œÜ(U) ‚üº œÜ(U). This gives the chart (œÜ(U), ùüô_œÜ(U)) on ‚Ñù^n. For the chart (U, œÜ) on N, we have the map
             ùüô_œÜ(U) ùò∞  œÜ ùò∞  œÜ^-1 : œÜ(U) ‚üº œÜ(U)
             which is of course smooth. Using 1) above, œÜ can then be seen to be smooth.

     [JV] nondegeneracy does not work either

Follow-up to our discussion today on IV.1.5: Consider the bilinear
form on R^2 defined by F((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = x2y1 - x1y2.

This is nondegenerate: for any (x1, x2) not equal to zero, we can find
a (y1, y2) such that F((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) is not zero.  (If x1 is not
zero, let y1 be zero and y2 nonzero.  If x2 is not zero, let y2 be
zero and y1 nonzero.)

However, restricted to the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by (1, 0), F
is identically zero and therefore degenerate.

Hence, it is possible for a bilinear form to be non-degenerate on a
vector space X but not on every subspace of X.

    - Ex 2b: S if affine iff H(S) = S.
    - Ex 3:  Simplex: k+1 linearly independent points are needed to span a
             k-dimensional affine space.
*** Sec II.3
    - Ex 1a: [BKT] is subtracting points allowed?
             [PHM] to the extent that d(x,x)=0 and d(x,y)=y-x
    - Ex 1b:
    - Ex 2:
    - Ex 3: Use definition of affine map (3.01) to prove...
    - Ex 3a:
    - Ex 3b:
    - Ex 3c: [BKT] what is the picture used to prove this?
             [PHM] use 3.01.
    - Ex 4a: [AHL] why is the empty set a flat?
             [PHM] formally, it satisfies the axioms of an affine space/subspace.
    - Ex 4b: [RJP] AX{y}=single pt {y}; begs question of inverse of A:Rn->Rq, q<n
             [PHM] probably cheating, but I leaned on group theory for this one
             [RJP] confusion due to wording of problem resolved: image of affine map is a single point => all vectors in domain live in null space
    - Ex 4c:
    - Ex 5a:
    - Ex 5b:
    - Ex 6: [BKT] want to use Lemma I.2.03, but why must B be linear?
    - Ex 7:
    - Ex 8: [PHM] Seems to me that they need to restrict the definition of the map M more,
                  I can't really see what they're driving at here.
    - Ex 9a:
    - Ex 9b: [PHM] Is this an example of Ex 9a where H(P) < X?

*** [AHL]
    - p. 48 Ex II.1.2d typo? Does that affect p. 46 1.05 proof part 2)?
    - p. 48 Ex II.1.2a should d_x^<-(X' x X') be d_x({x} x X') or d(X' x X')?
*** Sec II.3
    - [PHM] I excerpeted chapter 2 of Bergers Problems book, which has
      a nice exposition on affine spaces.

*** Sec I.2
    - Ex 1.2.6b: look at, talk about people's solutions
    - tangential topic: given a square matrix with random values, what
      is the probability that it has a rotational "factor"?  For 2x2
      matrices, the characteristic equation is x^2 - Tr*x + Det = 0,
      so the condition for having a rotation "factor" is Tr^2 - 4*Det
      < 0.  For 3x3 (or any odd x odd for that matter) there is always
      one real root, so it's never purely rotational (Hamilton?).

      See three png's filed under chapter 1.  I will elaborate if
      there is interest.
*** Sec I.3
    - Ex I.3.2d: discuss strategies for arriving at detC
    - Ex I.3.2e: [NBA] see notes "vol_det.pdf"fs
    - Ex I.3.7: [PHM] The algebra is easy, as is the conclusion, but
      the logical thread is tricky and may bear discussion.
*** Sec II.1
    - the many typos of this section.

*** General discussion
    - shall we move to weekly 1 hr or 40 minute meetings? (deal with
      after meeting.)
*** Sec I.1
    - Ex I.1.3: Intersection of 2 subspaces is a subspace this comes
      over directly from group theory (Alekseev problems 63 and 103),
      but if that's too glib, we can discuss further.  Essentially, the
      only thing you have to do is to demonstrate closure.
*** Sec I.2
    - Ex I.2.6(b,c): The interpretation in this problem is a good to
      have in one's head.
*** Sec I.3
    - Ex I.3.1a: See also, Alekseev problems 174-176.  The braid method
      that I [PHM] mentioned at our January meeting is a nice visual
      way to "prove" this one.  Reference: page 7 of "Office Hours with
      a Geometric Group Theorist" by Matt Clay & Dan Margalit (eds),
